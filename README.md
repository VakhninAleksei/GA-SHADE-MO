GA-SHADE-MO
This is a source code of the proposed evolutionary-based multi-objective algorithm, GA-SHADE-MO, for simultaneously tuning hyper-parameters of an ML algorithm and the used set of features. As an example, XGBoost regression was taken to be optimized using GA-SHADE-MO.

The folder with the results of the numerical experiments has been uploaded.
